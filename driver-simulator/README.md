# Driver simulator

Use this simulator to test your solution for the full-stack code challenge.

The driver simulator will:
1. Register all vehicles listed in the file `vehicles.json`
2. Update the vehicle location until it reaches its destination
3. De-register all vehicles when they are finished

## Get started

Install [node](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) and then run the following command:

```shell
$ node simulate localhost:3000
# Replace localhost:3000 with the host of your API
# node simulate <API URL>:<API Port>
```
